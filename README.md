# Ecommerce-Product-Page
----------------------------------

### Goal
Build a mobile-optimized app using Vue.js

### Product Listing
List all products with infinite scroll pagination. The cart icon can be just a counter of products in the cart.

### Product Detail
Clicking on a product card should reveal product description and specs. The specs section should be collapsible.
Favoriting a product in this view (heart icon) should reflect in the product listing view.
Adding 1+ products to cart should reflect in the cart icon in the product listing view.
